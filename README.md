## About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate engineering leader with a strong technical foundation and over 15 years of experience in software development and Linux environments. While my early career was all about writing code in C, Java, Scala, Golang, and JavaScript, today Iâ€™m focused on enabling and supporting engineering teams to achieve their best as an Engineering Manager.

- People Management: Building high-performing teams with psychological safety and transparency.
- Technical Topics: Linux, Open Source, DevOps, Software Architecture, and distributed systems.
- Philosophy & Strategy: Mental models, decision-making, and creating sustainable team cultures.

I thrive at the intersection of technology and people. My mission is to connect ideas and empower teams to deliver impactful solutions. I've worked in both service and product-based companies, leading distributed teams and delivering scalable SaaS and on-premise platforms.

Beyond management, I still enjoy staying hands-on with code and technology, keeping my skills sharp and my mind fit. For me, engineering isnâ€™t just a professionâ€”itâ€™s a lifelong passion.
